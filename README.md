# 👤 Gender and Age Detection using Synthetic Data

This project is a machine learning-based application that predicts a person's **gender** (Male/Female) and **age group** (Child/Adult/Senior) based on their **height**, **weight**, **voice pitch**, and **BMI**. The model is trained entirely on **synthetically generated data** to simulate demographic effects. It uses **Random Forest classifiers** along with **enhanced feature engineering** techniques for accurate predictions.

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be effectively trained on **synthetic datasets** to predict **real-world demographic attributes**. It simulates realistic variations in physical and vocal features due to:

- 👨‍🦰 Gender differences in physical traits (e.g., height, weight, voice pitch)
- 👶 Age-related changes in body structure and voice
- 🌪️ Noise and randomness simulating real-world data variance

Users interact through a **terminal-based CLI**, where they input their physical measurements, and the model returns **predicted gender and age group**, along with **confidence levels**.
